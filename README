File::Cmp - compare two files character by character

# Someone else has a lock on the File::Cmp module name in CPAN, so this
# module may need to be renamed if that author is unresponsive or
# unwilling to give up the module name...
#To install this module, use CPAN, for example:
#
#  cpanm File::Cmp

For the current release, see:

http://github.com/thrig/File-Cmp

which can be installed by cloning that directory then running `cpanm .`
therein.
